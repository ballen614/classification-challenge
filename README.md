# OSU AI Bootcamp - Challenge 13 - Classification Challenge
## Submitted by Brandon Allen
## Overview
In this challenge I was asked to pretend that I work at an Internet Service Provider (ISP) and was tasked with improving the email filtering system. I was provided with a dataset that contains information about emails, with two possible classifications: spam and not spam. The ISP asked me to take this dataset and develop a supervised machine learning (ML) model that accurately detected spam emails.

I created two classification models to fit the provided data, and evaluated which model was more accurate at detecting spam. The models I created were a logistic regression model and a random forest model.
